          We are <span className="text-tertiary font-semibold">G7-Team2</span>,
          a group of 3rd-year Artificial Intelligence students from
          <span className="font-semibold"> ENSIA</span> who came together this
          year during our Software Engineering course. What started as a class
          project quickly grew into a shared passion for collaboration and
          creativity. Our team brings together diverse talents â€” some of us are
          developers who bring logic and structure to life, others are designers
          who craft visuals and user experiences, and all of us share a deep
          curiosity for Artificial Intelligence and its applications. Through
          this portfolio project, we aim to represent our teamwork, technical
          growth, and our drive to transform ideas into meaningful digital
          creations.
